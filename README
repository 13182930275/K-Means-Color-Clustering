Another implementation of K-means algorithm for color quantization in the images. This one is highly commented, so some may find it useful.
However, it is slow(even for Matlab) due to inverse mapping. It does not store the assignment of the pixels but calculates the distance from the center of the cluster in every iteration. Therefore, it is not computation efficient.  
It does not need additional space, though. As the inverse mapping is computed on the fly, there is no need for storing the clustered pixels.  
`read_color_raw.m`  reads `.raw` color images. `readraw` reads grayscale `.raw` images.
